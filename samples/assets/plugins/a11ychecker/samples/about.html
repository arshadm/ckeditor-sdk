		<p>Accessibility Checker is an innovative solution that lets you <strong>inspect the accessibility level</strong> of content created in CKEditor and <strong>immediately solve</strong> any accessibility issues that are found.</p>
		<p>It is built upon three key elements:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>User Interface optimized for quick problem solving.</li>
		<li>Flexibility allowing you to use the accessibility checking engine of your choice.</li>
		<li>Quick Fix feature letting you fix common problems fully automatically!</li>
		</ul>
		<p>All of this comes bundled with a tight integration with CKEditor.</p>
		<h2 id="how-does-it-work-">How Does It Work?</h2>
		<p>A typical accessibility checking process can be simplified to the following three steps.</p>
		<h3 id="step-one-content-validation">Step One: Content Validation</h3>
		<p>First the Accessibility Checker inspects your output HTML code against predefined patterns of common accessibility problems. For that purpose Accessibility Checker uses a dedicated <strong>accessibility checking engine</strong>.</p>
		<p>The default checking engine is <a href="http://quailjs.org">Quail</a>, but you are free to integrate any other library you want &mdash; it can be written in JavaScript, PHP, Java, .NET or any other language of your choice.</p>
		<h3 id="step-two-report-issues">Step Two: Report Issues</h3>
		<p>Accessibility Checker will list all issues found and highlight them in your document. It will provide a more detailed description of what is wrong with each issue so you can verify and solve the problem.</p>
		<h3 id="step-three-fix-the-issue">Step Three: Fix the Issue</h3>
		<p>Fix the markup, so your content is free of accessibility issues. Thanks to the <a href="guide.html#using-quick-fixes">Quick Fix feature</a> correcting common problems is as easy as clicking a button. When there is no Quick Fix available, you can switch Accessibility Checker <a href="guide.html#switching-to-listening-mode">into listening mode</a> and make necessary corrections to your content manually, following the checking engine recommendations provided in the panel.</p>
		<h2 id="how-do-i-profit-from-accessible-content-">How Do I Profit from Accessible Content?</h2>
		<p>Here are just a few advantages of giving everyone access to your content.</p>
		<h3 id="increased-market-reach">Increased Market Reach</h3>
		<p>The more accessible your content is, the bigger market you can gain. It is estimated that <a href="http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789240685215_eng.pdf?ua=1">around 15.3%</a> of the world population has moderate or severe disabilities. This is a huge group of potential customers that you can reach when you improve the accessibility of your content.</p>
		<h3 id="conforming-to-legal-requirements">Conforming to Legal Requirements</h3>
		<p>Accessibility is crucial for certain entities including government institutions and big corporations who are obliged to conform to certain web accessibility standards when working for the public sector. These entities in turn request accessibility compliance from their partners &mdash; you!</p>
		<h3 id="future-proof-semantic-content">Future-Proof Semantic Content</h3>
		<p>Accessibility guidelines make your content more semantic, therefore it will be much easier to work on it using applications of tomorrow. Designing accessible content overlaps with mobile usability, too, which is exponentially growing in demand.</p>
		<h3 id="better-ux-for-all-users">Better UX for All Users</h3>
		<p>Following accessibilty guidelines helps fostering best content creation practices. This in turn brings better user experience not only for disabled people, but for your entire audience, including improvements for mobile users, older low performance PCs, keyboard-oriented users or older people.</p>
		<h3 id="better-seo">Better SEO</h3>
		<p>Again, a better, standards-compliant structure enables search engines to explore more content on your page. Better page indexing means higher positioning in search results and an increase of traffic on your website.</p>
		<h3 id="emphasize-social-responsibility">Emphasize Social Responsibility</h3>
		<p>By keeping your content accessible you prove that your business cares about your entire audience, does not exclude anyone from reaching it, and in general, does &quot;the right thing&quot;. That subtle advantage can help you build a positive public image both in the eyes of individual users as well as your B2B partners and potential customers.</p>
		<p>If you would like to read more about how your company can benefit from accessible content, refer to the <a href="http://cksource.com/blog/Commercial-Benefits-of-Accessibility">&quot;Commercial Benefits of Accessibility&quot;</a> article on CKSource blog.</p>
		<h2 id="what-s-so-special-about-accessibility-checker-">What&#39;s So Special About Accessibility Checker?</h2>
		<p>It is the first major attempt to make content accessibility checking fully integrated into your content creation workflow.</p>
		<p>You can validate your content on the fly, without leaving CKEditor.</p>
		<p>What is more, with Accessibility Checker we are introducing Quick Fixes. This feature will automatically, or with very little
		input from your side, correct some of the issues &mdash; reducing the amount of work to a bare minimum. With Quick Fixes you are able to solve issues within a blink of an eye!</p>
