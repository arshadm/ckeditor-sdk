			<h1>Classic Editor <a class="documentation" href="http://docs.ckeditor.com/#!/guide/dev_frame">Documentation</a></h1>

			<p>
				<strong>Classic editor</strong> is what most users learnt to associate with a WYSIWYG editor &mdash; a toolbar with an editing area placed in a specific position on the page, usually as a part of a form that you use to submit some content to the server. In this editing solution <strong>the styles of the editor content are separated from the styles of the surrounding page</strong>. It is particularly useful when:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Admininistration and frontend themes in a CMS are different &mdash; as in such case inheriting styles from the backend theme would make no sense.
				</li>
				<li>
					Edited content is rendered in different locations of a website that may have different styling &mdash; as in such case it is more efficient to just focus on creating semantically correct syntax.
				</li>
				<li>
					You need to provide an editor for a changing environment (e.g. a themable CMS) &mdash; where it is hard to predict how user themes will be constructed.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Due to focus on semantic markup and possible differences between the styles of content within the editor and the styles used when the content is rendered on a page, such editors are sometimes called <abbr title="What You See Is What You Mean">WYSIWYM</abbr> editors ("What You See Is What You Mean").
			</p>

			<h2 class="editor-title">Classic Editor with Default Styles</h2>

			<p>
				Classic editor uses its own set of default styles for edited content. In the editor instance below you can see that the font style, size, and colors on this page and inside the CKEditor editing area are different (e.g. the "Apollo 11" header is black, not green).
			</p>

				&lt;h1&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Saturn V carrying Apollo 11&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;assets/sample.jpg&quot;/&gt; Apollo 11&lt;/h1&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apollo 11&lt;/strong&gt; was the spaceflight that landed the first humans, Americans &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong&quot;&gt;Neil Armstrong&lt;/a&gt; and
				&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin&quot;&gt;Buzz Aldrin&lt;/a&gt;, on the Moon on July 20, 1969, at 20:18 UTC. Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface 6 hours
				later on July 21 at 02:56 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Armstrong spent about &lt;s&gt;three and a half&lt;/s&gt; two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less; and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5&amp;nbsp;kg) of lunar
				material for return to Earth. A third member of the mission, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Collins_(astronaut)&quot;&gt;Michael Collins&lt;/a&gt;, piloted the
				&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Command/Service_Module&quot;&gt;command&lt;/a&gt; spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it for the trip back to
				Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
			</textarea>

			<h2 class="editor-title">Classic Editor with Custom Styles</h2>

			<p>
				It is possible to specify custom styles for edited content with the <code><a href="http://docs.ckeditor.com/#!/api/CKEDITOR.config-cfg-contentsCss">CKEDITOR.config.contentsCss</a></code> option. In the editor instance below font size was increased and the colors of links, headers, and struck-through content were changed.

				later on July 21 at 02:56 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;

				By fine-tuning a stylesheet for CKEditor you can make your content look exactly the same both on the page and inside the editor.
			</p>
			<script>

				CKEDITOR.replace( 'editor1', {
					height: 260
				} );
				CKEDITOR.replace( 'editor2', {
					height: 260,
					/* We include the default CKEditor styles as well not to copy default styles. */
					contentsCss: [ '../vendor/ckeditor/contents.css', 'assets/css/classic.css' ]
				} );
