			<h1>Uploading Dropped and Pasted Images <a class="documentation" href="TODO">Documentation</a></h1>

			<p>
				The optional <a href="http://ckeditor.com/addon/embed">Upload Image</a> plugin enables support for uploading images that were dropped or pasted into the editor.
			</p>

			<p>(TODO move to docs?) Mention that http://docs.ckeditor.com/#!/api/CKEDITOR.config-cfg-uploadUrl must be set + link to docs (where it must be explained that if CKFinder is used response type must be set to JSON).</p>

			<p>(TODO move to docs?) Mention that Upload Image is composed from Upload Widget, File Tools and Notifications and those components allow to build different kind of integrations.</p>

			<h2>See For Yourself!</h2>

			<p>
				The sample below uses the <a href="http://ckeditor.com/addon/embed">Upload Image</a> plugin together with the <a href="http://ckeditor.com/addon/image2">Enhanced Image</a> plugin. Additional <a href="http://docs.ckeditor.com/#!/guide/dev_styles-section-widget-styles">widget styles</a> are defined to control image size and alignment.
			</p>

			<p>
				Try pasting or dropping images into the editor (you can drop multiple files at a time). You can also try to paste fragments of images (e.g. copied from Microsoft Paint or Preview).

<h1>Rosetta</h1>

<p>Rosetta is a robotic space probe built and launched by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency">European Space Agency</a>. Along with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philae_(spacecraft)">Philae</a>, its lander module, Rosetta is performing a detailed study of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/67P/Churyumov%E2%80%93Gerasimenko">comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko (67P)</a>. On 12 November 2014 the mission performed the first soft landing on a comet and returned data from the surface.</p>

<h2>Mission overview</h2>

<p>Rosetta was launched on 2 March 2004 on an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_5">Ariane 5</a> rocket and reached the comet on 6 August 2014, becoming the first spacecraft to orbit a comet. (Previous missions had conducted successful flybys of seven other comets.) It is one of ESA's Horizon 2000 cornerstone missions. The spacecraft consists of the Rosetta orbiter, which features 12 instruments, and the Philae lander, with nine additional instruments. The Rosetta mission will orbit 67P for 17 months and is designed to complete the most detailed study of a comet ever attempted. The spacecraft is controlled from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Operations_Centre">European Space Operations Centre</a> (ESOC), in Darmstadt, Germany. The planning for the operation of the scientific payload, together with the data retrieval, calibration, archiving and distribution, is performed from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Astronomy_Centre">European Space Astronomy Centre</a> (ESAC), in Villanueva de la Cañada, near Madrid, Spain. It has been estimated that in the decade preceding 2014, some 2,000 people assisted in the mission in some capacity.</p>

<p>The probe is named after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone">Rosetta Stone</a>, a stele of Egyptian origin featuring a decree in three scripts. The lander is named after the Philae obelisk, which bears a bilingual Greek and Egyptian hieroglyphic inscription. A comparison of its hieroglyphs with those on the Rosetta Stone catalysed the deciphering of the Egyptian writing system. Similarly, it is hoped that these spacecraft will result in better understanding of comets and the early Solar System. In a more direct analogy to its namesake, the Rosetta spacecraft also carries a micro-etched nickel alloy Rosetta disc donated by the Long Now Foundation inscribed with 13,000 pages of text in 1200 languages.</p>

<p>The spacecraft performed two asteroid flyby missions on its way to the comet. In 2007, Rosetta also performed a Mars swing-by (flyby). The craft completed its flyby of asteroid 2867 Šteins in September 2008 and of 21 Lutetia in July 2010. On 20 January 2014, Rosetta was taken out of a 31-month hibernation mode as it approached the comet.</p>

<p>Rosetta'​s Philae lander successfully made the first soft landing on a comet nucleus when it touched down on 67P on 12 November 2014. Astrophysicist Elizabeth Pearson said that although the future of the lander Philae is uncertain, Rosetta is the workhorse of the mission and its work will carry on.</p>
